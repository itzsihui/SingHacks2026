# Borneo — Project Description

**Two-sided agentic commerce:** merchants publish agent-ready catalogs; buyers discover and pay in one chat — with **Visa-scoped cards** and **USDC**, secured by a **CaMeL-shaped** settle lock against prompt injection.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Team / Project** | Borneo |
| **One-liner** | Agents that shop. Merchants that get paid. Catalog text that cannot steal the money. |

## 1. Problem

Most “AI shopping” demos stop before money moves — or they scrape HTML, invent SKUs, and ignore the merchant. Real agentic commerce has three hard gaps:

1. **Buyers** — No trustworthy checkout in chat. Fiat (Visa) and stablecoin rails are usually missing or bolted on outside the agent.
2. **Merchants** — Human storefronts only. No Visa receive + crypto bind, no machine-readable catalog (`llms.txt` / `catalog.json`) agents can trust.
3. **Prompt injection (the existential risk)** — Product titles and descriptions are **untrusted web data**. A hostile listing can instruct the agent to *ignore the buyer, retarget the payee, skip authorize, or exfiltrate card details*. If that text reaches the payment agent, the blast radius is **money and identity**, not a wrong product rank.

Prompt injection is widely recognized as one of the largest unsolved problems for LLM agents that touch tools and funds. Classifier-only defenses plateau; attackers only need one success.

## 2. Solution

**Borneo** is a two-sided network:

- **Merchant side** — Conversational onboard (chat / CSV / URL) → bind Visa receive + wallet → publish agent-discoverable storefronts.
- **Buyer side** — Fashion salesperson chat discovers **live** multi-merchant SKUs, builds a set/cart, and settles **in the same conversation** via Visa or USDC.

Security is not a warning banner. Inspired by Google DeepMind / ETH Zurich **CaMeL** (*Capabilities for Machine Learning* — [arXiv:2503.18813](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18813)), Borneo applies a **CaMeL-shaped control-flow lock** at settle:

- Catalog copy is **quarantined / typed** (injection-shaped listings flagged).
- Pay tools only accept a **locked quote**: `{ storeSlug, skuId, price, merchantAddress }`.
- Free-text titles **never** enter privileged pay tools — so poisoned copy cannot rewrite the payee or amount.

### AgentDojo highlight (why CaMeL)

On the **AgentDojo** agent-security benchmark, CaMeL demonstrated:

- **~77% task success with provable security** vs **~84%** undefended — about **7 points** of utility traded for a **design-level** guarantee.
- Strong **attack collapse** under capability / policy enforcement (far beyond heuristic sandwiching / spotlighting / tool filters).

Borneo productizes that principle for commerce: **untrusted catalog data must not own control flow when money moves.**

## 3. Key Features

| Feature | What judges should notice |
|---|---|
| **Buyer salesperson chat** | Intent → multi-query catalog search → ranked live SKUs (not a hardcoded aisle). |
| **Build your set / cart** | Add multiple pieces; pay cart in chat; each SKU settles on its own locked quote. |
| **Visa-scoped checkout** | Spend cap, merchant scope, authorize-first virtual card flow in chat. |
| **Visa-powered stablecoin rail** | Optional USDC settle via **HTTP 402 / x402** on Base Sepolia. |
| **Merchant agent onboard** | Inventory talk / CSV / URL → published store with agent discovery files. |
| **Agent storefront protocol** | Agents read `/llms.txt`, `/registry.json`, `/s/{slug}/catalog.json` — **no HTML scrape**. |
| **CaMeL-shaped quarantine + locked quotes** | Injection demo (e.g. hostile tee) flagged; settle still locks payee/amount. |
| **Market + governance** | Human/agent market index; buyer spend limits; merchant rail policies. |
| **Multi-chat history** | Collapsible sidebar of past buyer conversations. |

## 4. Technology

| Layer | Stack |
|---|---|
| App | Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Motion |
| Agents | OpenAI (salesperson + merchant); deterministic tool fallbacks without keys |
| Auth / data | Firebase Auth + Firestore profiles |
| Payments | Visa-scoped card flow (fiat-first); USDC on Base Sepolia via **viem** + **x402 / HTTP 402** |
| Protocol | Hono-style agent endpoints; machine catalogs for discovery |
| Security model | CaMeL-inspired quarantine reader + locked-quote settle (AgentDojo-validated design pattern) |
| Other | Zod, MetaMask (merchant bind), local/session persistence for demo reliability |

## 5. Implementation (real-world applicability)

**Today (hackathon / pilot)**  
A fashion marketplace where AI buyers shop in chat and merchants publish once for every agent on the network. Dual rails let risk/compliance lead with Visa authorize while crypto-native settle remains available.

**Production path**
1. Merchant KYC + Visa receive issuance; scoped cards from a licensed issuer.
2. Same discovery protocol (`llms.txt` / catalog JSON) as the integration contract for any agent buyer.
3. Policy engine expansion (CaMeL-style capabilities) on every privileged tool: pay, refund, PII export.
4. Governance already sketched: per-tx / daily spend caps and merchant listing controls.

**Why this ships:** settle is quote-locked by construction; catalogs stay machine-readable; both sides of the market exist in one product — so the demo is a network, not a monologue.

## 6. Additional Information

**Try the flows**
- `/buyer` — Shop chat → discover → Visa or USDC  
- Merchant onboard — inventory → publish store  
- `/market` — browse as human or agent  
- Seed stores under `/s/{slug}/llms.txt`

**Security demo tip for judges**  
Ask for the injection-shaped listing → see quarantine → open pay → confirm the **locked quote** still targets the correct merchant and amount. That is the CaMeL lesson applied to checkout.
